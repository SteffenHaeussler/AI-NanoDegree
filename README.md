# Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nano-Degree

The [Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nano-Degree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/ai-artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd898)
gives an introduction into artificial intelligence starting from the classical approaches to deep learnings. For the
2nd term I've chosen Computer Vision. Part of the classical AI part was alpha beta pruning, shortest path finding,
domain independent path planning, optimization techniques (simulated annealing) and hidden markov models and bayes nets.

# Projects

- [Capstone facial Keypoints](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/AI-NanoDegree/tree/master/facial_keypoints)
- [RNN](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/AI-NanoDegree/tree/master/rnn_regressor_classifier)
- [Image Classification](https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/AI-NanoDegree/tree/master/dog_breed_classifier)

- Sudoko solver
- Adversial Search Agent
- Domain-Independent Planner
- Hidden Markov Models

Rest of the projects aren't uploaded, because of unclear ownership of the supllementary code.
